# Chapter 1: A Pragmatic Philosophy

## It's your life

- If you are frustrated because of anything in your career, why can't you change it?
- Software is one of the most careers where you have control
  - The knowledge crosses geographic boundaries
  - We can work remotely
  - We are paid well
  - And more
- Try to fix your agency, but not forever, if you can't, just leave it

## The cat ate my source code

- Mistakes happen, even on the strongest processes
- Be responsible
- Don't loose your team trust
- When you make a mistake, admit it honestly and offer options
- don't blame anyone or anything
- Before you tell your boss the problem try to run the conversation in your mind first

## Software Entropy

- When disorder in software increases we call it "software rot" or "technical debt"
- One broken window may lead to a whole damaged building, don't leave one window damaged

## Stone Soup and Boiled Frogs

- If the whole change is large for accepting it, just be a catalyst for the change, and the others will help you
- People prefer to join a successfully process instead of starting one

## Good-Enough Software

- There are many circumistances against us, so we don't have full control of the faults
- meet the users requirements with the standards of performance, privacy and security
- Let the users tell you when you meet their needs

## Your Knowledge Portfolio

- Your power is in your knowledge
- The knwoledge assets are expiring fast
- invest regularly in your knowledge
- Invest diversely
- Manage the risk of leaning new things
- Learn undervalued technologies that may be valuable later
- If you got a question that you don't know its answer, try to find it
- Read in the spare time e.g when you're waiting for doctor
- Critically analyze what you read

## Communicate

- Know your audience
- plot out the ideas you want to write firest, then refine it until it delivers the ideas well
- Involve your audience
- Be a listener
- Get back to people if you don't have time now
- Document the code
